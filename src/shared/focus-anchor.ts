// Where focus goes back to when a dialog closes.
//
// A dialog — Home Assistant's more-info or one of the suite's own <dialog>s —
// remembers what had focus when it opened and hands focus back there on close,
// and the browser scrolls that element into view as it does. That is right when
// the element is the thing that opened the dialog. On a phone it usually is not:
// a tap on a card's header does not move focus at all, so focus is still sitting
// wherever it was left — a slider tapped three minutes and two screens ago — and
// closing the dialog throws the dashboard back up to it.
//
// Reported as "closing the vacuum's details scrolls the overview up to 9a", and
// reproduced exactly: focus on 9a's brightness slider, open 13c's details, close
// them, and the page jumps 4,318px to put the slider back on screen.
//
// So focus is parked on the opening card first, without scrolling. The dialog
// then returns it there, which is where the user already is.
//
// WHY THE CARD IS NOT PRECISE ENOUGH
//
// Anchoring the *card* trades a big jump for a smaller one. A vacuum card is
// most of a phone screen, and its chip row sits under the map and two sliders;
// closing a dialog opened from a chip scrolled the card's top edge into view
// and moved the page by the card's own height — "wir befinden uns bei einer
// anderen Kachel". So the anchor aims at the element the finger actually hit,
// remembered from the pointer that preceded the dialog, and falls back to the
// card when there is nothing better.
