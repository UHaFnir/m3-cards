// Two cards need this — the heading card folds the cards below it, the room
// card folds its own body — and they need it to behave identically, so the
// rule lives here rather than in two copies that drift.
//
// An `input_boolean` is the better home when one is configured: the state then
// survives a different browser, syncs between phone and tablet, and an
// automation can fold a section away. Without one the browser remembers it,
// which is per-device and good enough for a display preference.
//
// How long the browser remembers is a real choice, not a detail. Kept on the
// device, a section left open stays open for good — which is what someone who
// arranged the dashboard once wants, and a nuisance for someone who wants the
// overview back every time they come to it. Kept for the session, the fold
// follows you around the dashboard and is gone when the app is next started.
