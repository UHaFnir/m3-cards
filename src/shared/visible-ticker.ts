// A repeating callback that only runs while its card is actually on screen.
//
// A clock on a wall tablet runs for weeks. Left alone, a requestAnimationFrame
// loop keeps firing while the card is scrolled out of view, while another
// dashboard tab is in front, and while the screen is off — for a display nobody
// is looking at. This gates the loop on both signals a browser gives us:
// IntersectionObserver for "scrolled into view" and document.hidden for "this
// tab is in front".
//
// Three cadences, because the cheapest one that still looks right is the one to
// use:
//   "frame"  — every animation frame. Only for something that moves smoothly.
//   "second" — on each second boundary.
//   "minute" — on each minute boundary. A clock with no seconds and no moving
//              shape needs nothing more, and this is by far the cheapest.
//
// The callback receives `Date.now()`. It must not write reactive state on every
// frame: at 60Hz that is 60 renders a second for a reading that changes once a
// second at most. Compare what will actually be *shown* and only then assign —
// the same mistake cost the power-summary card 352 renders in 20 seconds.
