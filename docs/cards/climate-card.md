### Auto (heat/cool): a band, not one number

A thermostat in `heat_cool` — "Auto" on an Ecobee, and on most American
systems — does not hold one setpoint. It holds two: `target_temp_low`, the
temperature it heats up to, and `target_temp_high`, the one it starts cooling
above. In that mode there is no `temperature` attribute at all.

The card therefore reads the attributes, not the mode, and draws what is
actually there. A single setpoint gets the one stepper row it always had. A
band gets two of the same row stacked at the bottom of the card, labelled
"Heat to" and "Cool above", each with its own minus and plus. Nothing needs
to be configured — an entity that switches between `heat` and `heat_cool`
switches control with it.

Two rows rather than one slider with two handles: the card's target has
always been a large reading with a minus and a plus either side of it, and a
drag track would be a second idiom for the same job. On a six-column tile two
handles also sit close enough together to fight each other's touch targets.

The two bounds can neither cross nor meet — a thermostat asked to heat to 21
and cool above 21 is being asked to do both at once — so each one stops one
step short of the other. Every adjustment sends **both** bounds to
`climate.set_temperature`, even the one that did not move: several
integrations treat an omitted bound as "no opinion" and reset it to whatever
they had. If the entity reports only one of the two, both rows go inert
rather than guess at the other.

Earlier versions fell back to `target_temp_high` and presented it as if it
were a single setpoint — worse than showing nothing, because the plus and
minus then moved only the cooling bound while the label claimed it was the
target temperature (issue #22).

### Folding a room away

`collapsible: true` puts a chevron in the header and folds the card down to
that header when it is tapped. The subtitle stays — "occupied · 3 devices on"
is exactly what a folded room still needs to say, and a fold that hid it would
turn the card into a label.

The state persists per browser, or across devices in an `input_boolean` via
`collapse_state_entity` — which also lets an automation fold the guest room
away while nobody is in it.

```yaml
type: custom:m3-room-card
area: guest_room
collapsible: true
default_collapsed: true
```

Setting a header `tap_action` hands the header to that action and hides the
chevron, since the header no longer folds anything — see "Tapping the header".

### Configuration options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `entity` | string | **Required** | `climate.*` entity |
| `name` | string | entity `friendly_name` | Displayed name |
| `icon` | string | `mdi:radiator` (heating only) / `mdi:air-conditioner` | Header icon |
| `show_presets` | boolean | `true` | Show preset selector (if the entity supports `preset_modes`) |
| `preset_style` | `chip` \| `pill` | `chip` | Preset as its own wide row (`chip`) or as an extra pill in the mode row (`pill`) |
| `show_sensors` | boolean | `true` | Show sensor chips (temperature/humidity) |
| `temperature_chip_placement` | `info_row` \| `header` | `info_row` | Current temperature in the sensor row or as a chip top-right in the header |
| `temperature_sensor` | string | – | External temperature sensor, overrides `current_temperature` |
| `humidity_sensor` | string | – | External humidity sensor, overrides `current_humidity` |
| `window_sensor` | string | – | `binary_sensor`, shows an "Open" chip when `state: "on"` |
| `battery_sensor` | string | – | Sensor for battery level |
| `battery_threshold` | number | `20` | Threshold (%) below which the battery chip appears |
| `hidden_modes` | string[] | `[]` | HVAC modes that are hidden as a pill despite entity support |
| `glass_background` | boolean | `true` | Frosted glass background (off for solid themes) |
| `animations` | boolean | `true` | Shape-morph/press animations; `false` disables all transitions |
| `unavailable_style` | `dimmed` \| `normal` \| `hidden` | `dimmed` | Display when the entity is `unavailable`/`unknown`: `dimmed` (greyed out, not tappable, as before), `normal` (normal display, mode pills/stepper stay tappable), or `hidden` (card is fully hidden) |
| `height` | number (px) | – (automatic) | Fixed minimum card height. See [Equal-height tiles](#equal-height-tiles) |
| `radius` | number (px) | `32` | Card corner radius (editor offers Square/Slightly rounded/Round/Custom) |
| `corners` | object | – | Optional per-corner override: `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_right`, `bottom_left` (px) — for asymmetric Material 3 Expressive shapes, only overrides `radius` for the given corners |
| `mode_colors` | object | see below | Color override per HVAC mode. The editor shows a text field + color swatch; accepts hex/CSS **or** HA color names, same as the button card's `color` |
| `icon_active_color` | string | `var(--primary-color)` | Header icon color when active (not "off") |
| `icon_inactive_color` | string | `var(--primary-color)` | Header icon color in the "off" state |
| `plus_active_color` | string | current mode's color | Plus button color when active |
| `plus_inactive_color` | string | `mode_colors.off` | Plus button color in the "off" state |
| `minus_active_color` | string | `var(--primary-text-color)` | Minus button color when active |
| `minus_inactive_color` | string | `var(--primary-text-color)` | Minus button color in the "off" state |

Without any explicit setting, the icon stays in the theme accent color
(`--primary-color`) as before; minus stays neutral. `icon_active_color` /
`icon_inactive_color` / `plus_active_color` / `plus_inactive_color` /
`minus_active_color` / `minus_inactive_color` allow a fully independent
color per element and state ("off" vs. active).

#### Default mode colors

| Mode | Color |
|---|---|
| `off` | `#9e9e9e` |
| `heat` | `#e57368` |
| `cool` | `#6ba7dc` |
| `dry` | `#5dcaa5` |
| `auto` | `#5dcaa5` |
| `fan_only` | `#b8c4c9` |
| `heat_cool` | `#e5a768` |

### Equal-height tiles

HA's native masonry dashboard does **not** automatically equalize the
height of cards next to each other — every column grows independently
based on its own content. Two options:

1. **Use `horizontal-stack`** (recommended, no manual value needed): cards
   in a `horizontal-stack` are automatically stretched by Home Assistant
   via flexbox to the height of the tallest card — the M3 cards fill that
   height completely (including the stepper, which docks to the bottom):
   ```yaml
   type: horizontal-stack
   cards:
     - type: custom:m3-climate-card
       entity: climate.ac
     - type: custom:m3-climate-card
       entity: climate.living_room
   ```
2. **Set `height` manually**: if no `horizontal-stack` is used, a fixed
   pixel value (`height: 380`) can be set per card.
